Vignette abstract: Our vignette presents a comprehensive exploration of XGBoost, including its mathematical principles, programming language support, and practical application in classification problems. Our vignette is conducted on a simulated “Credit Card Fraud” dataset obtained on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud/data). This dataset presents a binary classification problem, classifying transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. With 8 variables and a total of 1,000,000 observations.
